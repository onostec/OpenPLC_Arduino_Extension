The Arduino Extension is a newly added feature to the OpenPLC editor. It allows Arduino Sketches to be added to and run alongside a PLC program. It supports almost every Arduino library and code that can run on the Arduino IDE, include external libraries and user functions. This feature allows the integration of an I2C LCD into the Arduino Nano PLC to produce a low-cost HMI display.

This Arduino Nano PLC is produced by J R Electrokits and is based on the open-source hardware Outseal PLC Nano, an Outseal automation technology brand. Based on the Arduino Nano Inputs/Outputs, it has 8 fixed digital optocoupler inputs, 2 analog 0–5V or 0–20mA outputs, 6 relay outputs, 2 PWM outputs, Modbus communication, the UART port, an I2C port, and an inbuilt external memory.
